# exercise_yourself
This is a small app that allows you to record your water intake, steps taken and type of exercise for each day of the month.
You can also display the statistics for steps clicking on the Statistics button. Moreover, you can display the pie chart for which exercise was the most popular one for that month.
It is tracking default values of 2000 ml of water and 8000 of steps and will display a checkmark if the target has been achieved.
activity_level contains a sample of recording from the app.
